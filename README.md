# Alex Rowe's Portfolio

This is the repository for my personal portfolio, built with Astro and hosted as a static site with Github Pages.

## Tech Used

- **Astro**: A static site builder that uses modern JavaScript and server-side rendering.
- **TypeScript**: For static typing and enhanced development experience.
- **React**: For certain sections, the improved ability to manage state and dynamically render content based on that state.
